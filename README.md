## 💫 About Me
Hello, I am Abdullah AYDOĞAN. I graduated from Marmara University - Computer Programming and Anadolu University - Management Information Systems departments.

When I was a computer programming student, I made a mobile wallpaper application as my graduation project. I improved my coding skills with this application.

I follow the innovations in the industry and am willing to constantly learn and improve myself.
